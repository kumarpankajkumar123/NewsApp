# News Application

## Overview

In the development of this news application, several key technologies were employed to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience.

### REST API Integration

The application utilizes RESTful APIs to dynamically fetch and display the latest news content. This approach establishes a seamless communication channel between the client (mobile app) and external servers, adhering to RESTful principles for efficient data retrieval.

### Adapter Class and RecyclerView

The core of the news feed is powered by the Adapter class and RecyclerView implementation. The Adapter class serves as a bridge between the data source (fetched from the API) and the RecyclerView, managing view creation and binding. Leveraging RecyclerView enhances the user experience with smooth scrolling and optimized memory usage.

# ConstraintLayout for Responsive UI

To ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface, ConstraintLayout  was employed in the design. This flexible layout facilitates the creation of complex UIs, optimizing the arrangement and alignment of UI elements. It plays a crucial role in maintaining a consistent and adaptable layout across various screen sizes.
